Key Concepts

	1.	Product:
	•	A product in Printful refers to a general item or template that you can customize. For example, a t-shirt, hoodie, mug, or any other printable item in their catalog.
	•	Each product will have multiple variants, which are different versions of that same product (e.g., sizes, colors, etc.).
Example:
	•	Product: T-Shirt
	•	Variants: Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Color variants (Black, White, Red)
	2.	Variant:
	•	A variant is a specific version of a product that combines different attributes like size, color, or style.
	•	For example, if you have a t-shirt available in 3 sizes and 2 colors, each combination (small-black, medium-white) is considered a different variant.
Example:
	•	Product: T-Shirt
	•	Variant 1: Small, Black
	•	Variant 2: Medium, White
	•	Variant 3: Large, Red
In the API, you will refer to these specific variants by their variant IDs.
	3.	Sync Product:
	•	Sync refers to synchronizing a product from your custom store (or a store created through the API) with Printful’s system so that it is ready for fulfillment.
	•	Essentially, you’re telling Printful: “Here’s my product (with designs and specific variants), and I want you to manage the printing and fulfillment.”
	•	The Sync Product API creates a connection between your custom product and Printful so that Printful knows which product to print and ship when an order is placed.
